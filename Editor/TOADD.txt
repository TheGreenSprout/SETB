EditorPrefAttribute (Custom Attributes, Unity Methods):
	+ Haven't read or understood code. This is a non ai field bud
	+ Maybe add support for object type in the editorpref functions?

+ Lists' code is so messy, see if theres any way to shorten it.
+ Add a button that can receive an Action<int> instead of only an action.
